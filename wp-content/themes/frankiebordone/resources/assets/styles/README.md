# eidigital/sass-scaffolding

Hierarchical group of useful Sass rules, configs, functions, and mixins for getting started with a new project. Lovingly developed by [@abelthomas](https://github.com/abelthomas).

This is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the `/resources/assets/styles` directory in the [roots/sage](https://github.com/roots/sage) starter theme, but can be useful for any front-end project using Sass.

`fonts.scss` requires [webfontloader](https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader) to be set up. If you're using Sage, a good place to do this would be `/resources/assets/scripts/routes/common.js`.
